# showcase
Showcase of code that I've written, for potential employers who may be interested in examples of my work.

I'm a computational biologist with a MS in bioinformatics and a Ph.D. covering evolutionary biology. I'm interested in using computational techniques, evolutionary theory, and statistics to answer biological questions. My training makes me particularly well-suited to questions involving cancer evolution.
