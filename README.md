# showcase
Showcase of code that I've written, for potential employers who may be interested in examples of my work.

I'm a computational biologist with a MS in bioinformatics and a Ph.D. covering evolutionary biology. I'm interested in using computational techniques, evolutionary theory, and statistics to answer biological questions. My training makes me particularly well-suited to questions involving cancer evolution.

The folder "ribo-downsampling" contains some of the work that I did in an internship under the direction of Dr. Adam Labadorf at Boston University in the summer and fall of 2019. The two Snakemake files showcase some of my bash work, and the accompanying scripts show algorithms that I developed and implemented in Python. The accompanying .Rmd file is the code for visualizing the results in R.

The code in "algorithm_for_estimating_migration_rates_by_phylogeographic_reconstruction.ipynb" is an example of a more advanced algorithm for which I developed the concept and code. This algorithm was written as part of a course project at Boston University. It uses a number of techniques from computational biology and evolutionary biology, including HMMs, EM and ML methods, message-passing along phylogenetic trees, and coalescent theory. The accompanying .pdf explains how this algorithm functions.

The file "Knitting_RMET_5_20_2019" showcases an R analysis of a large dataset that I'm working on with Dr. Jeremy Wilmer at Wellesley College. It's a more extensive demonstration of my R skills and statistical knowledge.
